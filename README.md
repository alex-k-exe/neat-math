# neat-math
A collection of things/explanations of math that I think are neat


## Converting if statements into math functions
My goal here is to transform simple if statements (e.g. if x > 0 then) into mathematical functions (e.g. f(x) = |x| / x) by using set theory and number line transformations.


## Negative numbers in geometry
